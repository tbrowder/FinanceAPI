Create a minimum json file for each of the query types
for ease of documentation.

Put tests needing an API key in /xt. Make note in
the docs.

For free tier, these work:
  /v8/finance/spark # history, daily
    range: 6mo
    interval: 1d
    symbols 1..10: mrk, jagix

  /v8/finance/chart/{ticker}
    1 symbol per query
    range: 6mo
    interval: 1d
    event: div/split
