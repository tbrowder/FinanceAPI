NAME
====

**FinanceAPI** - Provides routines for querying securities information using 'https://Financeapi.net'

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use FinanceAPI;
...
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

**FinanceAPI** has a set of routines to extract financial data from various markets around the world using their APIs. There is a free tier with a limit of 100 queries per day. The user must obtain a personal API key in order to successfully use the full capability of this module to get desired data. See the details at [https://financeapi.net](https://financeapi.net).

Note the API key obtained *must* be assigned to the user's environment variable `FINANCEAPI_APIKEY`. In a Linux OS one could do this in the user's `$HOME/.bash_aliases` file:

    export FINANCEAPI_APIKEY='dEfvhygSrfbFttgyhjfe3huj'

Note tests in /t do not need an API key, but tests in /xt do.

Current status

The following three query paths and their routines are currently available.

Other query paths are defined the Financeapi.net website, but they have not yet been handled. File an issue or, better yet, submit a PR if you want others.

Their default values should give usable data for the past six months. Their default values are set for the author's convenience for testing the free tier:
